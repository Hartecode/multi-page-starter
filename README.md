#Multi-Page Starter

This starter gives a quick start for a multiple page front end application. This start is built with webpack, babel, sass, autoprefixer, storybook and style lint.

To start development
```npm start```

To run a production build:
```npm run build```

To run storybook
```npm run storybook```

##Making new page

A static site is built and put in the pages folder in the src folder. The name of the page folder is used for the built html page. Each page folder needs at least an index.html and a index.js. The styling for the template should be imported in the index.js file.
